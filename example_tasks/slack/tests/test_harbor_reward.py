"""The reward Harbor actually reads.

The layered verifier is only worth building if it is the thing that scores the
run. These tests cover the seam: an `EpisodeEvaluation` becoming the flat
key/value stream Harbor stores, and the entry point that assembles it for this
task. The properties that matter are that the key set never changes between a
graded run and a blank one -- an analysis that has to guess whether a missing
key means zero or means "not measured" is not an analysis -- and that partial
work is paid partially.
